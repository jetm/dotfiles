# Javier's dotfiles and some home-made utilities

My shell configuration files and some utilities. Recommended use them with zsh,
although they work fine with bash.

## <a name="install">Installation</a>

```sh
$ dotfiles/bin/install-dotfiles
```

## Remove dotfiles:

```sh
$ dotfiles/bin/install-dotfiles -u
```

You can use it, copy it, distribute it... be my guest :)
