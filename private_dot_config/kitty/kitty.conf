#: Scrollback {{{

scrollback_lines -1

#: Number of lines of history to keep in memory for scrolling back.
#: Memory is allocated on demand. Negative numbers are (effectively)
#: infinite scrollback. Note that using very large scrollback is not
#: recommended as it can slow down performance of the terminal and
#: also use large amounts of RAM. Instead, consider using
#: scrollback_pager_history_size. Note that on config reload if this
#: is changed it will only affect newly created windows, not existing
#: ones.

scrollback_pager less --chop-long-lines --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS +INPUT_LINE_NUMBER

#: Program with which to view scrollback in a new window. The
#: scrollback buffer is passed as STDIN to this program. If you change
#: it, make sure the program you use can handle ANSI escape sequences
#: for colors and text formatting. INPUT_LINE_NUMBER in the command
#: line above will be replaced by an integer representing which line
#: should be at the top of the screen. Similarly CURSOR_LINE and
#: CURSOR_COLUMN will be replaced by the current cursor position or
#: set to 0 if there is no cursor, for example, when showing the last
#: command output.

scrollback_pager_history_size 0

#: Separate scrollback history size (in MB), used only for browsing
#: the scrollback buffer with pager. This separate buffer is not
#: available for interactive scrolling but will be piped to the pager
#: program when viewing scrollback buffer in a separate window. The
#: current implementation stores the data in UTF-8, so approximatively
#: 10000 lines per megabyte at 100 chars per line, for pure ASCII,
#: unformatted text. A value of zero or less disables this feature.
#: The maximum allowed size is 4GB. Note that on config reload if this
#: is changed it will only affect newly created windows, not existing
#: ones.

scrollback_fill_enlarged_window no

#: Fill new space with lines from the scrollback buffer after
#: enlarging a window.

wheel_scroll_multiplier 5.0

#: Multiplier for the number of lines scrolled by the mouse wheel.
#: Note that this is only used for low precision scrolling devices,
#: not for high precision scrolling devices on platforms such as macOS
#: and Wayland. Use negative numbers to change scroll direction. See
#: also wheel_scroll_min_lines.

wheel_scroll_min_lines 1

#: The minimum number of lines scrolled by the mouse wheel. The scroll
#: multiplier wheel_scroll_multiplier only takes effect after it
#: reaches this number. Note that this is only used for low precision
#: scrolling devices like wheel mice that scroll by very small amounts
#: when using the wheel. With a negative number, the minimum number of
#: lines will always be added.

touch_scroll_multiplier 1.0

#: Multiplier for the number of lines scrolled by a touchpad. Note
#: that this is only used for high precision scrolling devices on
#: platforms such as macOS and Wayland. Use negative numbers to change
#: scroll direction.

#: }}}

#: Mouse {{{

mouse_hide_wait 3.0

#: Hide mouse cursor after the specified number of seconds of the
#: mouse not being used. Set to zero to disable mouse cursor hiding.
#: Set to a negative value to hide the mouse cursor immediately when
#: typing text. Disabled by default on macOS as getting it to work
#: robustly with the ever-changing sea of bugs that is Cocoa is too
#: much effort.

url_color #0087bd
url_style curly

#: The color and style for highlighting URLs on mouse-over. url_style
#: can be one of: none, straight, double, curly, dotted, dashed.

open_url_with default

#: The program to open clicked URLs. The special value default means
#: to use the operating system's default URL handler (open on macOS
#: and xdg-open on Linux).

url_prefixes file ftp ftps gemini git gopher http https irc ircs kitty mailto news sftp ssh

#: The set of URL prefixes to look for when detecting a URL under the
#: mouse cursor.

detect_urls yes

#: Detect URLs under the mouse. Detected URLs are highlighted with an
#: underline and the mouse cursor becomes a hand over them. Even if
#: this option is disabled, URLs are still clickable.

# url_excluded_characters

#: Additional characters to be disallowed from URLs, when detecting
#: URLs under the mouse cursor. By default, all characters that are
#: legal in URLs are allowed.

copy_on_select yes

#: Copy to clipboard or a private buffer on select. With this set to
#: clipboard, selecting text with the mouse will cause the text to be
#: copied to clipboard. Useful on platforms such as macOS that do not
#: have the concept of primary selection. You can instead specify a
#: name such as a1 to copy to a private kitty buffer. Map a shortcut
#: with the paste_from_buffer action to paste from this private
#: buffer. For example::

#:     copy_on_select a1
#:     map shift+cmd+v paste_from_buffer a1

#: Note that copying to the clipboard is a security risk, as all
#: programs, including websites open in your browser can read the
#: contents of the system clipboard.

paste_actions quote-urls-at-prompt

#: A comma separated list of actions to take when pasting text into
#: the terminal. The supported paste actions are:

#: quote-urls-at-prompt:
#:     If the text being pasted is a URL and the cursor is at a shell prompt,
#:     automatically quote the URL (needs shell_integration).
#: confirm:
#:     Confirm the paste if bracketed paste mode is not active or there is more
#:     a large amount of text being pasted.
#: filter:
#:     Run the filter_paste() function from the file paste-actions.py in
#:     the kitty config directory on the pasted text. The text returned by the
#:     function will be actually pasted.

strip_trailing_spaces never

#: Remove spaces at the end of lines when copying to clipboard. A
#: value of smart will do it when using normal selections, but not
#: rectangle selections. A value of always will always do it.

select_by_word_characters @-./_~?&=%+#

#: Characters considered part of a word when double clicking. In
#: addition to these characters any character that is marked as an
#: alphanumeric character in the Unicode database will be matched.

# select_by_word_characters_forward

#: Characters considered part of a word when extending the selection
#: forward on double clicking. In addition to these characters any
#: character that is marked as an alphanumeric character in the
#: Unicode database will be matched.

#: If empty (default) select_by_word_characters will be used for both
#: directions.

click_interval -1.0

#: The interval between successive clicks to detect double/triple
#: clicks (in seconds). Negative numbers will use the system default
#: instead, if available, or fallback to 0.5.

focus_follows_mouse no

#: Set the active window to the window under the mouse when moving the
#: mouse around.

pointer_shape_when_grabbed arrow

#: The shape of the mouse pointer when the program running in the
#: terminal grabs the mouse. Valid values are: arrow, beam and hand.

default_pointer_shape beam

#: The default shape of the mouse pointer. Valid values are: arrow,
#: beam and hand.

pointer_shape_when_dragging beam

#: The default shape of the mouse pointer when dragging across text.
#: Valid values are: arrow, beam and hand.

#: Mouse actions {{{

#: Mouse buttons can be mapped to perform arbitrary actions. The
#: syntax is:

#: .. code-block:: none

#:     mouse_map button-name event-type modes action

#: Where button-name is one of left, middle, right, b1 ... b8 with
#: added keyboard modifiers. For example: ctrl+shift+left refers to
#: holding the Ctrl+Shift keys while clicking with the left mouse
#: button. The value b1 ... b8 can be used to refer to up to eight
#: buttons on a mouse.

#: event-type is one of press, release, doublepress, triplepress,
#: click, doubleclick. modes indicates whether the action is performed
#: when the mouse is grabbed by the program running in the terminal,
#: or not. The values are grabbed or ungrabbed or a comma separated
#: combination of them. grabbed refers to when the program running in
#: the terminal has requested mouse events. Note that the click and
#: double click events have a delay of click_interval to disambiguate
#: from double and triple presses.

#: You can run kitty with the kitty --debug-input command line option
#: to see mouse events. See the builtin actions below to get a sense
#: of what is possible.

#: If you want to unmap an action, map it to no_op. For example, to
#: disable opening of URLs with a plain click::

#:     mouse_map left click ungrabbed no_op

#: See all the mappable actions including mouse actions here
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/actions/>.

#: .. note::
#:     Once a selection is started, releasing the button that started it will
#:     automatically end it and no release event will be dispatched.

clear_all_mouse_actions no

#: Remove all mouse action definitions up to this point. Useful, for
#: instance, to remove the default mouse actions.

#: Click the link under the mouse or move the cursor

mouse_map left click ungrabbed mouse_handle_click selection link prompt

#::  First check for a selection and if one exists do nothing. Then
#::  check for a link under the mouse cursor and if one exists, click
#::  it. Finally check if the click happened at the current shell
#::  prompt and if so, move the cursor to the click location. Note
#::  that this requires shell integration

#: Click the link under the mouse or move the cursor even when grabbed

mouse_map shift+left click grabbed,ungrabbed mouse_handle_click selection link prompt

#::  Same as above, except that the action is performed even when the
#::  mouse is grabbed by the program running in the terminal.

#: Click the link under the mouse cursor

mouse_map ctrl+shift+left release grabbed,ungrabbed mouse_handle_click link

#::  Variant with Ctrl+Shift is present because the simple click based
#::  version has an unavoidable delay of click_interval, to
#::  disambiguate clicks from double clicks.

#: Discard press event for link click

mouse_map ctrl+shift+left press grabbed discard_event

#::  Prevent this press event from being sent to the program that has
#::  grabbed the mouse, as the corresponding release event is used to
#::  open a URL.

#: Paste from the primary selection

mouse_map middle release ungrabbed paste_from_selection

#::  Select from the clicked point to the end of the line.

#: Extend the current selection

mouse_map right press ungrabbed mouse_selection extend

#::  If you want only the end of the selection to be moved instead of
#::  the nearest boundary, use move-end instead of extend.

#: Paste from the primary selection even when grabbed

#: Performance tuning {{{

repaint_delay 10

#: Delay between screen updates (in milliseconds). Decreasing it,
#: increases frames-per-second (FPS) at the cost of more CPU usage.
#: The default value yields ~100 FPS which is more than sufficient for
#: most uses. Note that to actually achieve 100 FPS, you have to
#: either set sync_to_monitor to no or use a monitor with a high
#: refresh rate. Also, to minimize latency when there is pending input
#: to be processed, this option is ignored.

input_delay 3

#: Delay before input from the program running in the terminal is
#: processed (in milliseconds). Note that decreasing it will increase
#: responsiveness, but also increase CPU usage and might cause flicker
#: in full screen programs that redraw the entire screen on each loop,
#: because kitty is so fast that partial screen updates will be drawn.

sync_to_monitor yes

#: Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. This
#: prevents screen tearing
#: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing> when scrolling.
#: However, it limits the rendering speed to the refresh rate of your
#: monitor. With a very high speed mouse/high keyboard repeat rate,
#: you may notice some slight input latency. If so, set this to no.

#: }}}

#: Terminal bell {{{

enable_audio_bell no

#: The audio bell. Useful to disable it in environments that require
#: silence.

visual_bell_duration 0.0

#: The visual bell duration (in seconds). Flash the screen when a bell
#: occurs for the specified number of seconds. Set to zero to disable.

visual_bell_color none

#: The color used by visual bell. Set to none will fall back to
#: selection background color. If you feel that the visual bell is too
#: bright, you can set it to a darker color.

window_alert_on_bell yes

#: Request window attention on bell. Makes the dock icon bounce on
#: macOS or the taskbar flash on linux.

bell_on_tab "🔔 "

#: Some text or a Unicode symbol to show on the tab if a window in the
#: tab that does not have focus has a bell. If you want to use leading
#: or trailing spaces, surround the text with quotes. See
#: tab_title_template for how this is rendered.

#: For backwards compatibility, values of yes, y and true are
#: converted to the default bell symbol and no, n, false and none are
#: converted to the empty string.

command_on_bell none

#: Program to run when a bell occurs. The environment variable
#: KITTY_CHILD_CMDLINE can be used to get the program running in the
#: window in which the bell occurred.

bell_path none

#: Path to a sound file to play as the bell sound. If set to none, the
#: system default bell sound is used. Must be in a format supported by
#: the operating systems sound API, such as WAV or OGA on Linux
#: (libcanberra) or AIFF, MP3 or WAV on macOS (NSSound)

#: }}}

#: Window layout {{{

remember_window_size  yes
initial_window_width  640
initial_window_height 400

#: If enabled, the window size will be remembered so that new
#: instances of kitty will have the same size as the previous
#: instance. If disabled, the window will initially have size
#: configured by initial_window_width/height, in pixels. You can use a
#: suffix of "c" on the width/height values to have them interpreted
#: as number of cells instead of pixels.

enabled_layouts *

#: The enabled window layouts. A comma separated list of layout names.
#: The special value all means all layouts. The first listed layout
#: will be used as the startup layout. Default configuration is all
#: layouts in alphabetical order. For a list of available layouts, see
#: the layouts <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/overview/#layouts>.

window_resize_step_cells 2
window_resize_step_lines 2

#: The step size (in units of cell width/cell height) to use when
#: resizing kitty windows in a layout with the shortcut
#: start_resizing_window. The cells value is used for horizontal
#: resizing, and the lines value is used for vertical resizing.

window_border_width 0.5pt

#: The width of window borders. Can be either in pixels (px) or pts
#: (pt). Values in pts will be rounded to the nearest number of pixels
#: based on screen resolution. If not specified, the unit is assumed
#: to be pts. Note that borders are displayed only when more than one
#: window is visible. They are meant to separate multiple windows.

draw_minimal_borders yes

#: Draw only the minimum borders needed. This means that only the
#: borders that separate the inactive window from a neighbor are
#: drawn. Note that setting a non-zero window_margin_width overrides
#: this and causes all borders to be drawn.

window_margin_width 0

#: The window margin (in pts) (blank area outside the border). A
#: single value sets all four sides. Two values set the vertical and
#: horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal and bottom. Four
#: values set top, right, bottom and left.

single_window_margin_width -1

#: The window margin to use when only a single window is visible (in
#: pts). Negative values will cause the value of window_margin_width
#: to be used instead. A single value sets all four sides. Two values
#: set the vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top,
#: horizontal and bottom. Four values set top, right, bottom and left.

window_padding_width 0

#: The window padding (in pts) (blank area between the text and the
#: window border). A single value sets all four sides. Two values set
#: the vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal
#: and bottom. Four values set top, right, bottom and left.

placement_strategy center

#: When the window size is not an exact multiple of the cell size, the
#: cell area of the terminal window will have some extra padding on
#: the sides. You can control how that padding is distributed with
#: this option. Using a value of center means the cell area will be
#: placed centrally. A value of top-left means the padding will be
#: only at the bottom and right edges.

active_border_color #00ff00

#: The color for the border of the active window. Set this to none to
#: not draw borders around the active window.

inactive_border_color #cccccc

#: The color for the border of inactive windows.

bell_border_color #ff5a00

#: The color for the border of inactive windows in which a bell has
#: occurred.

inactive_text_alpha 1.0

#: Fade the text in inactive windows by the specified amount (a number
#: between zero and one, with zero being fully faded).

hide_window_decorations no

#: Hide the window decorations (title-bar and window borders) with
#: yes. On macOS, titlebar-only can be used to only hide the titlebar.
#: Whether this works and exactly what effect it has depends on the
#: window manager/operating system. Note that the effects of changing
#: this option when reloading config are undefined.

window_logo_path none

#: Path to a logo image. Must be in PNG format. Relative paths are
#: interpreted relative to the kitty config directory. The logo is
#: displayed in a corner of every kitty window. The position is
#: controlled by window_logo_position. Individual windows can be
#: configured to have different logos either using the launch action
#: or the remote control <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/remote-
#: control/> facility.

window_logo_position bottom-right

#: Where to position the window logo in the window. The value can be
#: one of: top-left, top, top-right, left, center, right, bottom-left,
#: bottom, bottom-right.

window_logo_alpha 0.5

#: The amount the logo should be faded into the background. With zero
#: being fully faded and one being fully opaque.

resize_debounce_time 0.1

#: The time to wait before redrawing the screen when a resize event is
#: received (in seconds). On platforms such as macOS, where the
#: operating system sends events corresponding to the start and end of
#: a resize, this number is ignored.

resize_draw_strategy static

#: Choose how kitty draws a window while a resize is in progress. A
#: value of static means draw the current window contents, mostly
#: unchanged. A value of scale means draw the current window contents
#: scaled. A value of blank means draw a blank window. A value of size
#: means show the window size in cells.

resize_in_steps no

#: Resize the OS window in steps as large as the cells, instead of
#: with the usual pixel accuracy. Combined with initial_window_width
#: and initial_window_height in number of cells, this option can be
#: used to keep the margins as small as possible when resizing the OS
#: window. Note that this does not currently work on Wayland.

visual_window_select_characters 1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

#: The list of characters for visual window selection. For example,
#: for selecting a window to focus on with focus_visible_window. The
#: value should be a series of unique numbers or alphabets, case
#: insensitive, from the set [0-9A-Z]. Specify your preference as a
#: string of characters.

confirm_os_window_close -1

#: Ask for confirmation when closing an OS window or a tab with at
#: least this number of kitty windows in it by window manager (e.g.
#: clicking the window close button or pressing the operating system
#: shortcut to close windows) or by the close_tab action. A value of
#: zero disables confirmation. This confirmation also applies to
#: requests to quit the entire application (all OS windows, via the
#: quit action). Negative values are converted to positive ones,
#: however, with shell_integration enabled, using negative values
#: means windows sitting at a shell prompt are not counted, only
#: windows where some command is currently running. Note that if you
#: want confirmation when closing individual windows, you can map the
#: close_window_with_confirmation action.

#: }}}

#: Tab bar {{{

tab_bar_edge down

#: The edge to show the tab bar on, top or bottom.

tab_bar_margin_width 0.0

#: The margin to the left and right of the tab bar (in pts).

tab_bar_margin_height 0.0 0.0

#: The margin above and below the tab bar (in pts). The first number
#: is the margin between the edge of the OS Window and the tab bar.
#: The second number is the margin between the tab bar and the
#: contents of the current tab.

tab_bar_style powerline

#: The tab bar style, can be one of:

#: fade
#:     Each tab's edges fade into the background color. (See also tab_fade)
#: slant
#:     Tabs look like the tabs in a physical file.
#: separator
#:     Tabs are separated by a configurable separator. (See also
#:     tab_separator)
#: powerline
#:     Tabs are shown as a continuous line with "fancy" separators.
#:     (See also tab_powerline_style)
#: custom
#:     A user-supplied Python function called draw_tab is loaded from the file
#:     tab_bar.py in the kitty config directory. For examples of how to
#:     write such a function, see the functions named draw_tab_with_* in
#:     kitty's source code: kitty/tab_bar.py. See also
#:     this discussion <https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/discussions/4447>
#:     for examples from kitty users.
#: hidden
#:     The tab bar is hidden. If you use this, you might want to create a mapping
#:     for the select_tab action which presents you with a list of tabs and
#:     allows for easy switching to a tab.

tab_bar_align left

#: The horizontal alignment of the tab bar, can be one of: left,
#: center, right.

tab_bar_min_tabs 2

#: The minimum number of tabs that must exist before the tab bar is
#: shown.

tab_switch_strategy previous

#: The algorithm to use when switching to a tab when the current tab
#: is closed. The default of previous will switch to the last used
#: tab. A value of left will switch to the tab to the left of the
#: closed tab. A value of right will switch to the tab to the right of
#: the closed tab. A value of last will switch to the right-most tab.

tab_fade 0.25 0.5 0.75 1

#: Control how each tab fades into the background when using fade for
#: the tab_bar_style. Each number is an alpha (between zero and one)
#: that controls how much the corresponding cell fades into the
#: background, with zero being no fade and one being full fade. You
#: can change the number of cells used by adding/removing entries to
#: this list.

tab_separator " ┇"

#: The separator between tabs in the tab bar when using separator as
#: the tab_bar_style.

tab_powerline_style angled

#: The powerline separator style between tabs in the tab bar when
#: using powerline as the tab_bar_style, can be one of: angled,
#: slanted, round.

tab_activity_symbol none

#: Some text or a Unicode symbol to show on the tab if a window in the
#: tab that does not have focus has some activity. If you want to use
#: leading or trailing spaces, surround the text with quotes. See
#: tab_title_template for how this is rendered.

tab_title_template "{fmt.fg.red}{bell_symbol}{activity_symbol}{fmt.fg.tab}{title}"

#: A template to render the tab title. The default just renders the
#: title with optional symbols for bell and activity. If you wish to
#: include the tab-index as well, use something like: {index}:{title}.
#: Useful if you have shortcuts mapped for goto_tab N. If you prefer
#: to see the index as a superscript, use {sup.index}. All data
#: available is:

#: title
#:     The current tab title.
#: index
#:     The tab index useable with goto_tab N goto_tab shortcuts.
#: layout_name
#:     The current layout name.
#: num_windows
#:     The number of windows in the tab.
#: num_window_groups
#:     The number of window groups (not counting overlay windows) in the tab.
#: tab.active_wd
#:     The working directory of the currently active window in the tab (expensive,
#:     requires syscall).
#: max_title_length
#:     The maximum title length available.

#: Note that formatting is done by Python's string formatting
#: machinery, so you can use, for instance, {layout_name[:2].upper()}
#: to show only the first two letters of the layout name, upper-cased.
#: If you want to style the text, you can use styling directives, for
#: example:
#: `{fmt.fg.red}red{fmt.fg.tab}normal{fmt.bg._00FF00}greenbg{fmt.bg.tab}`.
#: Similarly, for bold and italic:
#: `{fmt.bold}bold{fmt.nobold}normal{fmt.italic}italic{fmt.noitalic}`.
#: Note that for backward compatibility, if {bell_symbol} or
#: {activity_symbol} are not present in the template, they are
#: prepended to it.

active_tab_title_template none

#: Template to use for active tabs. If not specified falls back to
#: tab_title_template.

active_tab_foreground   #000
active_tab_background   #eee
active_tab_font_style   bold-italic
inactive_tab_foreground #444
inactive_tab_background #999

#: Advanced {{{

shell .

#: The shell program to execute. The default value of . means to use
#: whatever shell is set as the default shell for the current user.
#: Note that on macOS if you change this, you might need to add
#: --login and --interactive to ensure that the shell starts in
#: interactive mode and reads its startup rc files.

editor .

#: The terminal based text editor (such as vim or nano) to use when
#: editing the kitty config file or similar tasks.

#: The default value of . means to use the environment variables
#: VISUAL and EDITOR in that order. If these variables aren't set,
#: kitty will run your shell ($SHELL -l -i -c env) to see if your
#: shell startup rc files set VISUAL or EDITOR. If that doesn't work,
#: kitty will cycle through various known editors (vim, emacs, etc.)
#: and take the first one that exists on your system.

close_on_child_death no

#: Close the window when the child process (shell) exits. With the
#: default value no, the terminal will remain open when the child
#: exits as long as there are still processes outputting to the
#: terminal (for example disowned or backgrounded processes). When
#: enabled with yes, the window will close as soon as the child
#: process exits. Note that setting it to yes means that any
#: background processes still using the terminal can fail silently
#: because their stdout/stderr/stdin no longer work.

# remote_control_password

#: Allow other programs to control kitty using passwords. This option
#: can be specified multiple times to add multiple passwords. If no
#: passwords are present kitty will ask the user for permission if a
#: program tries to use remote control with a password. A password can
#: also *optionally* be associated with a set of allowed remote
#: control actions. For example::

#:     remote_control_password "my passphrase" get-colors set-colors focus-window focus-tab

#: Only the specified actions will be allowed when using this
#: password. Glob patterns can be used too, for example::

#:     remote_control_password "my passphrase" set-tab-* resize-*

#: To get a list of available actions, run::

#:     kitty @ --help

#: A set of actions to be allowed when no password is sent can be
#: specified by using an empty password, for example::

#:     remote_control_password "" *-colors

#: Finally, the path to a python module can be specified that provides
#: a function is_cmd_allowed that is used to check every remote
#: control command. See rc_custom_auth
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/remote-control/#rc-custom-auth>
#: for details. For example::

#:     remote_control_password "my passphrase" my_rc_command_checker.py

#: Relative paths are resolved from the kitty configuration directory.

allow_remote_control no

#: Allow other programs to control kitty. If you turn this on, other
#: programs can control all aspects of kitty, including sending text
#: to kitty windows, opening new windows, closing windows, reading the
#: content of windows, etc. Note that this even works over SSH
#: connections. The default setting of no prevents any form of remote
#: control. The meaning of the various values are:

#: password
#:    Remote control requests received over both the TTY device and the socket are
#:    confirmed based on passwords, see remote_control_password.

#: socket-only
#:    Remote control requests received over a socket are accepted unconditionally.
#:    Requests received over the TTY are denied. See listen_on.

#: socket
#:    Remote control requests received over a socket are accepted unconditionally.
#:    Requests received over the TTY are confirmed based on password.

#: no
#:    Remote control is completely disabled.

#: yes
#:    Remote control requests are always accepted.

listen_on none

#: Listen to the specified UNIX socket for remote control connections.
#: Note that this will apply to all kitty instances. It can be
#: overridden by the kitty --listen-on command line option, which also
#: supports listening on a TCP socket. This option accepts only UNIX
#: sockets, such as unix:${TEMP}/mykitty or unix:@mykitty (on Linux).
#: Environment variables are expanded and relative paths are resolved
#: with respect to the temporary directory. If {kitty_pid} is present,
#: then it is replaced by the PID of the kitty process, otherwise the
#: PID of the kitty process is appended to the value, with a hyphen.
#: See the help for kitty --listen-on for more details. Note that this
#: will be ignored unless allow_remote_control is set to either: yes,
#: socket or socket-only. Changing this option by reloading the config
#: is not supported.

# env

#: Specify the environment variables to be set in all child processes.
#: Using the name with an equal sign (e.g. env VAR=) will set it to
#: the empty string. Specifying only the name (e.g. env VAR) will
#: remove the variable from the child process' environment. Note that
#: environment variables are expanded recursively, for example::

#:     env VAR1=a
#:     env VAR2=${HOME}/${VAR1}/b

#: The value of VAR2 will be <path to home directory>/a/b.

# watcher

#: Path to python file which will be loaded for watchers
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/launch/#watchers>. Can be
#: specified more than once to load multiple watchers. The watchers
#: will be added to every kitty window. Relative paths are resolved
#: relative to the kitty config directory. Note that reloading the
#: config will only affect windows created after the reload.

# exe_search_path

#: Control where kitty finds the programs to run. The default search
#: order is: First search the system wide PATH, then ~/.local/bin and
#: ~/bin. If still not found, the PATH defined in the login shell
#: after sourcing all its startup files is tried. Finally, if present,
#: the PATH specified by the env option is tried.

#: This option allows you to prepend, append, or remove paths from
#: this search order. It can be specified multiple times for multiple
#: paths. A simple path will be prepended to the search order. A path
#: that starts with the + sign will be append to the search order,
#: after ~/bin above. A path that starts with the - sign will be
#: removed from the entire search order. For example::

#:     exe_search_path /some/prepended/path
#:     exe_search_path +/some/appended/path
#:     exe_search_path -/some/excluded/path

update_check_interval 24

#: The interval to periodically check if an update to kitty is
#: available (in hours). If an update is found, a system notification
#: is displayed informing you of the available update. The default is
#: to check every 24 hours, set to zero to disable. Update checking is
#: only done by the official binary builds. Distro packages or source
#: builds do not do update checking. Changing this option by reloading
#: the config is not supported.

startup_session none

#: Path to a session file to use for all kitty instances. Can be
#: overridden by using the kitty --session command line option for
#: individual instances. See sessions
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/overview/#sessions> in the kitty
#: documentation for details. Note that relative paths are interpreted
#: with respect to the kitty config directory. Environment variables
#: in the path are expanded. Changing this option by reloading the
#: config is not supported.

#clipboard_control write-clipboard write-primary read-clipboard-ask read-primary-ask
clipboard_control write-clipboard write-primary read-clipboard read-primary

#: Allow programs running in kitty to read and write from the
#: clipboard. You can control exactly which actions are allowed. The
#: possible actions are: write-clipboard, read-clipboard, write-
#: primary, read-primary, read-clipboard-ask, read-primary-ask. The
#: default is to allow writing to the clipboard and primary selection
#: and to ask for permission when a program tries to read from the
#: clipboard. Note that disabling the read confirmation is a security
#: risk as it means that any program, even the ones running on a
#: remote server via SSH can read your clipboard. See also
#: clipboard_max_size.

clipboard_max_size 64

#: The maximum size (in MB) of data from programs running in kitty
#: that will be stored for writing to the system clipboard. A value of
#: zero means no size limit is applied. See also clipboard_control.

# file_transfer_confirmation_bypass

#: The password that can be supplied to the file transfer kitten
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/transfer/> to skip the
#: transfer confirmation prompt. This should only be used when
#: initiating transfers from trusted computers, over trusted networks
#: or encrypted transports, as it allows any programs running on the
#: remote machine to read/write to the local filesystem, without
#: permission.

allow_hyperlinks yes

#: Process hyperlink escape sequences (OSC 8). If disabled OSC 8
#: escape sequences are ignored. Otherwise they become clickable
#: links, that you can click with the mouse or by using the hints
#: kitten <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/hints/>. The
#: special value of ask means that kitty will ask before opening the
#: link when clicked.

shell_integration enabled

#: Enable shell integration on supported shells. This enables features
#: such as jumping to previous prompts, browsing the output of the
#: previous command in a pager, etc. on supported shells. Set to
#: disabled to turn off shell integration, completely. It is also
#: possible to disable individual features, set to a space separated
#: list of these values: no-rc, no-cursor, no-title, no-cwd, no-
#: prompt-mark, no-complete. See Shell integration
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/> for details.

allow_cloning ask

#: Control whether programs running in the terminal can request new
#: windows to be created. The canonical example is clone-in-kitty
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/#clone-shell>.
#: By default, kitty will ask for permission for each clone request.
#: Allowing cloning unconditionally gives programs running in the
#: terminal (including over SSH) permission to execute arbitrary code,
#: as the user who is running the terminal, on the computer that the
#: terminal is running on.

clone_source_strategies venv,conda,env_var,path

#: Control what shell code is sourced when running clone-in-kitty in
#: the newly cloned window. The supported strategies are:

#: venv
#:     Source the file $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/activate. This is used by the
#:     Python stdlib venv module and allows cloning venvs automatically.
#: conda
#:     Run conda activate $CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV. This supports the virtual
#:     environments created by conda.
#: env_var
#:     Execute the contents of the environment variable
#:     KITTY_CLONE_SOURCE_CODE with eval.
#: path
#:     Source the file pointed to by the environment variable
#:     KITTY_CLONE_SOURCE_PATH.

#: This option must be a comma separated list of the above values.
#: This only source the first valid one in the above order.

term xterm-kitty

#: The value of the TERM environment variable to set. Changing this
#: can break many terminal programs, only change it if you know what
#: you are doing, not because you read some advice on "Stack Overflow"
#: to change it. The TERM variable is used by various programs to get
#: information about the capabilities and behavior of the terminal. If
#: you change it, depending on what programs you run, and how
#: different the terminal you are changing it to is, various things
#: from key-presses, to colors, to various advanced features may not
#: work. Changing this option by reloading the config will only affect
#: newly created windows.

#: }}}

#: OS specific tweaks {{{

wayland_titlebar_color system

#: The color of the kitty window's titlebar on Wayland systems with
#: client side window decorations such as GNOME. A value of system
#: means to use the default system color, a value of background means
#: to use the background color of the currently active window and
#: finally you can use an arbitrary color, such as #12af59 or red.

linux_display_server auto

#: Choose between Wayland and X11 backends. By default, an appropriate
#: backend based on the system state is chosen automatically. Set it
#: to x11 or wayland to force the choice. Changing this option by
#: reloading the config is not supported.

#: }}}

#: Keyboard shortcuts {{{

#: Keys are identified simply by their lowercase Unicode characters.
#: For example: a for the A key, [ for the left square bracket key,
#: etc. For functional keys, such as Enter or Escape, the names are
#: present at Functional key definitions
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/#functional>.
#: For modifier keys, the names are ctrl (control, ⌃), shift (⇧), alt
#: (opt, option, ⌥), super (cmd, command, ⌘). See also: GLFW mods
#: <https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__mods.html>

#: On Linux you can also use XKB key names to bind keys that are not
#: supported by GLFW. See XKB keys
#: <https://github.com/xkbcommon/libxkbcommon/blob/master/include/xkbcommon/xkbcommon-
#: keysyms.h> for a list of key names. The name to use is the part
#: after the XKB_KEY_ prefix. Note that you can only use an XKB key
#: name for keys that are not known as GLFW keys.

#: Finally, you can use raw system key codes to map keys, again only
#: for keys that are not known as GLFW keys. To see the system key
#: code for a key, start kitty with the kitty --debug-input option,
#: kitty will output some debug text for every key event. In that text
#: look for native_code, the value of that becomes the key name in the
#: shortcut. For example:

#: .. code-block:: none

#:     on_key_input: glfw key: 0x61 native_code: 0x61 action: PRESS mods: none text: 'a'

#: Here, the key name for the A key is 0x61 and you can use it with::

#:     map ctrl+0x61 something

#: to map Ctrl+A to something.

#: You can use the special action no_op to unmap a keyboard shortcut
#: that is assigned in the default configuration::

#:     map kitty_mod+space no_op

#: If you would like kitty to completely ignore a key event, not even
#: sending it to the program running in the terminal, map it to
#: discard_event::

#:     map kitty_mod+f1 discard_event

#: You can combine multiple actions to be triggered by a single
#: shortcut with combine action, using the syntax below::

#:     map key combine <separator> action1 <separator> action2 <separator> action3 ...

#: For example::

#:     map kitty_mod+e combine : new_window : next_layout

#: This will create a new window and switch to the next available
#: layout.

#: You can use multi-key shortcuts with the syntax shown below::

#:     map key1>key2>key3 action

#: For example::

#:     map ctrl+f>2 set_font_size 20

#: The full list of actions that can be mapped to key presses is
#: available here <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/actions/>.

kitty_mod ctrl+shift

#: Special modifier key alias for default shortcuts. You can change
#: the value of this option to alter all default shortcuts that use
#: kitty_mod.

clear_all_shortcuts yes

#: Remove all shortcut definitions up to this point. Useful, for
#: instance, to remove the default shortcuts.

# action_alias

#: E.g. action_alias launch_tab launch --type=tab --cwd=current

#: Define action aliases to avoid repeating the same options in
#: multiple mappings. Aliases can be defined for any action and will
#: be expanded recursively. For example, the above alias allows you to
#: create mappings to launch a new tab in the current working
#: directory without duplication::

#:     map f1 launch_tab vim
#:     map f2 launch_tab emacs

#: Similarly, to alias kitten invocation::

#:     action_alias hints kitten hints --hints-offset=0

# kitten_alias

#: E.g. kitten_alias hints hints --hints-offset=0

#: Like action_alias above, but specifically for kittens. Generally,
#: prefer to use action_alias. This option is a legacy version,
#: present for backwards compatibility. It causes all invocations of
#: the aliased kitten to be substituted. So the example above will
#: cause all invocations of the hints kitten to have the --hints-
#: offset=0 option applied.

#: Clipboard {{{

#: Copy to clipboard

map kitty_mod+c copy_to_clipboard
map cmd+c       copy_to_clipboard

#::  There is also a copy_or_interrupt action that can be optionally
#::  mapped to Ctrl+C. It will copy only if there is a selection and
#::  send an interrupt otherwise. Similarly,
#::  copy_and_clear_or_interrupt will copy and clear the selection or
#::  send an interrupt if there is no selection.

#: Paste from clipboard

map kitty_mod+v paste_from_clipboard
map cmd+v       paste_from_clipboard

#: Paste from selection

map kitty_mod+s  paste_from_selection
map shift+insert paste_from_selection

#: Scroll to next shell prompt

map kitty_mod+x scroll_to_prompt 1

#: Browse scrollback buffer in pager

map kitty_mod+h show_scrollback

#::  You can pipe the contents of the current screen and history

#::      map f1 launch --stdin-source=@screen_scrollback --stdin-add-formatting --type=overlay less +G -R

#::  For more details on piping screen and buffer contents to external
#::  programs, see launch <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/launch/>.

#: Browse output of the last shell command in pager

map kitty_mod+g show_last_command_output

#::  You can also define additional shortcuts to get the command
#::  output. For example, to get the first command output on screen::

#::      map f1 show_first_command_output_on_screen

#::  To get the command output that was last accessed by a keyboard
#::  action or mouse action::

#::      map f1 show_last_visited_command_output

#::  You can pipe the output of the last command run in the shell
#::  using the launch action. For example, the following opens the
#::  output in less in an overlay window::

#::      map f1 launch --stdin-source=@last_cmd_output --stdin-add-formatting --type=overlay less +G -R

#::  To get the output of the first command on the screen, use
#::  @first_cmd_output_on_screen. To get the output of the last jumped
#::  to command, use @last_visited_cmd_output.

#::  Requires shell integration

#: Window management {{{

#: New window

map kitty_mod+enter new_window
map cmd+enter       new_window

#::  You can open a new kitty window running an arbitrary program, for
#::  example::

#::      map kitty_mod+y launch mutt

#::  You can open a new window with the current working directory set
#::  to the working directory of the current window using::

#::      map ctrl+alt+enter launch --cwd=current

#::  You can open a new window that is allowed to control kitty via
#::  the kitty remote control facility with launch --allow-remote-
#::  control. Any programs running in that window will be allowed to
#::  control kitty. For example::

#::      map ctrl+enter launch --allow-remote-control some_program

#::  You can open a new window next to the currently active window or
#::  as the first window, with::

#::      map ctrl+n launch --location=neighbor
#::      map ctrl+f launch --location=first

#::  For more details, see launch
#::  <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/launch/>.

#: New OS window

map kitty_mod+n new_os_window
map cmd+n       new_os_window
